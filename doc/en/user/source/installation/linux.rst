The setup instructions are very similar to that of the Mac OS X :ref:`installation_osx_bin`.  

Java
----

GeoServer requires Java to be installed on your system.  Oracle Java SE 6 or newer is strongly recommended.  (As of GeoServer 2.2.x, Oracle JRE 5 is no longer supported.)  A Java Development Kit (JDK) is not required to run GeoServer.  For more information about Java and GeoServer, please see the section on :ref:`production_java`.
