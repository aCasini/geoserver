Filtering in GeoServer
======================

Filtering allows selecting features that satisfy a specific set of conditions. 
Filters can be used in several contexts in GeoServer:

- in WMS, to select which features should be displayed on a map
- in WFS, to specify the features to be returned by a request
- in SLD, to apply different symbolization to features on a thematic map.
